# Chapter 2 Exercise 6 Homework

'''
My initial guesses:

(a) 5 % 2 = 1

(b) 9 % 5 = 4

(c) 15 % 12 = 3

(d) 12 % 15 = 0

(e) 6 % 6 = 0

(f) 0 % 7 = 7

(g) 7 % 0 = 7

'''

print("5 % 2 =", 5 % 2, "\n9 % 5 =", 9 % 5, "\n15 % 12 =", 15 % 12,
      "\n12 % 15 =", 12 % 15, "\n6 % 6 =", 6 % 6, "\n0 % 7 =", 0 % 7,
      "\n7 % 0 = error")

'''
After seeing answers:

(a) Correct

(b) Correct

(c) Correct

(d) Incorrect, I thought it would have gotten mad a defaulted to zero but it looks
    like 15 can't go into 12 so it moves 12 to the remainder spot in order to start
    processing the results but once that happens we have our answer.
    
(e) Correct

(f) Incorrect, I wasn't sure so I, as a lesser computer, just defaulted to 7 hoping
    hoping my guess was correct. After running the code and thinking about it 0 is
    nothing. Surprisingly enough nothing can't go into something making the out put nothing.
    
(g) Incorrect, If I would have thought about it just a little more I would have gotten it but 
    7 divide by 0 is in undefined and with out l'hopital's rule and simplification python can not
    solve this problem.
