# Chapter 2 Exercise 7 Homework

'''

Exercise 7:
You look at the clock and it is exactly 2pm. You set an alarm to go off in 51 hours. At
what time does the alarm go off? (Hint: you could count on your fingers, but this is not
what weâ€™re after. If you are tempted to count on your fingers, change the 51 to 5100.)
